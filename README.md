# cardsagainstlan

## What is this?

It's cards against humanity but as a LAN mobile game.

## Why have you done this?

Corona times. Also, the internet at home keeps going down :(

### BUT

LAN games still work when you're not connected to the internet.

This will even work if everybody connects to one guy's hotspot.

I've never been this bored. I was gonna use cordova or something like that but I needed to create DatagramSockets and use multiple threads.
